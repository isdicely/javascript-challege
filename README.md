JavaScript Challenge -  JavaScript and DOM Manipulation

Background:
In this exercise a basic sitem using HTML, CSS and JS is created to display the data provided related to UFO sightings.  
The site contains user interation that allows to filter the data provided before it is displayed

Process:
The site was created to meet the fist level (UFO-level-1) criteria requested. 
    Contents of the UFO-level-1 folder:
        index.html:
            html code for site
        style.css:
            style elements for the site
        UFO_pic_1.png:
            picture used as site's background
        static folder:
            index.js:
                contains code used to import data, filter and modify hmlt based on user interaction
            js_data.js:
                UFO sightings data provided

The site was built from scratch (did not use the starter code (index.html) provided). it pulls the dataset provided, and appends a table based on the user selection by listening for an event change. 

The page was designed using bootstrap containers and set to be responsive based on window sizes.


Note:
UFO-level-2 (bonus) was not coded.
